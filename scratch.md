# Programming with Scratch! 

What is scratch? Scratch is a simple interactive programming language that was developed to be fun and easy to use! What can we do with scratch?

- learn some programing concepts
- learn some practical algorithms
- have fun creating games, stories and art! 

Scratch programs are built using blocks in that interconnect with each other to perform tasks. There are a couple key blocks to look at, Events, Motion and Control. These blocks allow you to control the sprite, or sprites you have on the screen. The interface is broken up into a few important areas.

#### The Scratch Environment

- STAGE: where information is displayed / stuff happens
- SPRITE: an image/graphic that we can control 
- SCRIPT: another name for a program or method, tells the sprite what to do
- SEQUENCE/BLOCK: a simple script or program. the computer will follow the instructions in order.


## Menu Overview

Here are a couple key block types that will help you program some great projects!

### Events blocks
Used to start a program, should the program start on the click of the green flag, or when a key is pressed.

### Motion
The Motion blocks are used to locate, orient, and move a sprite (their position on the stage).

### Control
The Control blocks give you the ability to control the flow of your program, should something loop 10 times? Should something only run if a condition is true?

### Operators
The Operators blocks let you do addition, pick a random number, or check if something greater than something else.

### Looks
The Looks blocks have instructions for setting the colour, size, visiblity of a sprite.

### Sensing
The Sensing blocks get some information from the user or some other part of the page.

### Sounds 
The Sounds block let us use a sound library, you can also upload your own sounds to use in your programs.

### Level 1

#### Challenge: Walk the walk

**Objective:** Pick a sprite, you can use the cat that is the default, or pick a new one. Can you make the character move across the screen 10 steps 10 steps at a time?

**Where to guide learns:**

- **Events** (dark gold) - use these blocks to determine when the movement should start.
- **Motion** (dark blue) - use the move block to determine how far to move the sprite.

**Possible Solution:**


#### Challenge: Click and move

**Objective:** When you click on the sprite(cat) can you make it glide to x 100 and y 0 and then say something?

**Where to guide learns:**
- **Events** (dark gold) - use these blocks to start some code, there is a click event for example
- **Motion** (dark blue) - these blocks are used to move the sprite around, you can more in steps, rotate, or maybe glide to an x/y position.
- **Looks** (royal purple) - the blocks in here allow you to change things about the sprites. 

**Possible Solution:**


#### Challenge: Square dancing

**Objective:** Scratch the cat wants to do dancing! Can you make them dance in a square? Have scratch move for 50 steps, wait 1 second turn 90deg and wait 1 second. Then repeat 4 times! Bonus challenge: can you make the cat draw a hexagon? What would you need to change?

**Where to guide learners:**
- **Events** (dark gold) - use these blocks to start some code, there is a click event for example
- **Motion** (dark blue) - these blocks are used to move the sprite around, you can more in steps, rotate, or maybe glide to an x/y position.
- **Controls** (gold) - controls are used to control the program, want it to repeat, wait, use some controls!
- **Pen** (green) - use the pen to actually draw your shape. You can set pen colour (numbers correspond to different colours) - can you make it choose a random colour every time around? 


**Possible Solution:**


### Level 2

#### Challenge: I Love Cheesy Puffs
**Objective:** You will need 2 sprites: one character to walk around the room, and a bowl of cheesy puffs! Can you make your character move around the space when you press the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) and, if they touch the bowl of cheesy puffs, say “I love cheesy puffs!” The character shouldn't say anything unless they are actually touching the bowl. 

**Where to guide learners:**
- **Control** (yellow) - you’ll need to use some if statements to check if an arrow key is being pressed, and if the cheesy puffs are being touched. You’ll also need to figure out how to make these things happen all the time, not just once!
- **Sensing** (blue) - this is the section where you can detect different keyboard events and whether one thing is touching another on the screen.
- **Motion** (dark blue) - move your sprites around using the x and y axis. (hint: the y axis is up and down, and the x axis is left and right!) 
- **Looks** (purple) - make your sprite say something here

**Potential Solution:**



#### Challenge: Sneezing Cat
**Objective** Scratch the cat has to sneeze! When the S key is pressed, Make the cat say "ahhh" and grow 5 bigger 20 times. then, have the cat say "chew" and shrink the cat by 5 (repeat that 20 times too!)

**Where to guide learners**
- **Events** (Dark Gold) - tie the action to the 's' key using an event in this panel
- **Control** (yellow) - to have your block repeat, find a repeat loop here
-**Looks** (purple) - change what your sprite says and looks like here! 

**Potential Solution** 


### Level 3


#### Challenge: Devin and the ghoul
**Objective:** Devin does not like ghouls! However this is one flying above them! Can you make a little game with two sprites, Devin and a Ghoul or ghost! Make Devin be able to move left and right with the arrow keys, and have the ghoul forever move 10 steps, but when they hit the edge they should bounce! Hint, rotate the ghoul at first to get them moving all over the screen. And if you have multiple sprites, clicking on one in the sprites panel will show you the scripts area for that sprite.

**Where to guide learners:**
- **Events** (dark gold) - use these blocks to determine when the movement should start.
- **Control** (yellow) - you’ll need to use forever and if statements to check for key events and things like that!
- **Sensing** (blue) - this is the section where you can detect different keyboard events and whether one thing is touching another on the screen.
- **Motion** (dark blue) - move your sprites around using the x and y axis. (hint: the y axis is up and down, and the x axis is left and right!) 

**Possible Solution:**

**Devin:**

**Ghoul/Ghost:**

#### Challenge: Spirograph
**Objective:** Use a sprite to draw a square (like in square dancing). This time, can you get your sprite to shift slightly and continue to draw more squares in a circular pattern like a spirograph? Bonus points if you can get the pen to change colours each square. 

**Where to guide learners:**
- **Events** (dark gold) - use these blocks to start some code, there is a click event for example
- **Motion** (dark blue) - these blocks are used to move the sprite around, you can more in steps, rotate, or maybe glide to an x/y position.
- **Controls** (gold) - controls are used to control the program, want it to repeat, wait, use some controls!
- **Pen** (green) - use the pen to actually draw your shape. You can set pen colour (numbers correspond to different colours) - can you make it choose a random colour every time around? 

**Possible Solution:**
