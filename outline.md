# What is Code.
Code is a way that we as humans can interact with machines. When we use a computer, a phone or a tablet, we are using pre-defined commands to complete tasks.

We can write the commands ourselves by writing in languages designed for computers. To speak to computers via websites we write in HTML and CSS. Using these languages, we can add our own text, give it colour and even include images and videos!

When we write code, we are telling the computer how to translate our code into a language that the computer understands! It then takes our code and tells the tiny parts inside of the computer what to do in order to display it on our screen.

# HTML and CSS
The base languages used by computer, phone and tablet browsers to show webpages are HTML and CSS.

If you think of a webpage as a building, HTML is the foundation and layout while CSS is the design.

## HTML

HTML, or Hyper Text Markup Language is used to define the layout and structure of our web pages.
All webpages use HTML to define how the page should be read and what text and images should be included.

HTML helps us layout the webpage and organize our content into sections that make sense.

Let's take a look at the [Wikipedia page for HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) and identify some common sections throughout. We can clearly see the content on the page organized into different sections such as titles, paragraphs and lists.

## CSS

CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets are how we give our web pages colour and personality. CSS exists as a separate language than HTML, however works well with it!

CSS allows us to change the colour of parts of our page, choose the font to use on our content and even help us layout parts of our page.
