# Thimble

[Mozilla Thimble](https://thimble.mozilla.org/en-US/) is a free, online tool that allows HTML and CSS to be written directly in the browser and instantly see the result. Thimble also offers the ability to create pre-written projects that can be modified ('remixed') by learners and then published and shared online.

Learners do not require an account to start coding but if you want to save projects, you will need to signup.

All HTML pages require some default, starter code in order to render properly.

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  <title>Made with Thimble</title>
</head>
<body>

  <h1>Welcome to Thimble</h1>

  <p>Make something <strong>amazing</strong> with the web!</p>

</body>
</html>
```

This code will appear by default in any newly created HTML pages within Thimble. It helps tell the browser some information about the page and how to render it.
